This project focused on improving patient triage and reducing inefficiencies in Montanaro Hospital's observation unit. We applied clustering analysis, logistic regression, and random forest models to classify patient outcomes, identify key predictors of inpatient transitions, and optimize operational workflows. The final logistic model, using only four variables—Gender, DRG01, Primary Insurance Category, and Blood Pressure Lower—offered a parsimonious yet effective approach for early identification of patients likely to “flip” to inpatient care. Random forest modeling further validated the influence of physiological features like pulse and temperature, while cluster analysis uncovered distinct patient groups that contribute to OU congestion. Our recommendations include adopting the final logistic model and integrating clustering insights to inform data-driven triage protocols. All code for the models, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis is available in the Code and Dataset folder, alongside the full report and presentation.
